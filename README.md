Access DeviantArt's "Sit Back" page without Flash.

## What is this

Lean Forward started out as a Firefox extension, but I quickly learned that the task was better suited as a GreaseMonkey user script. So now it's that.

The idea is to allow people the same functionality on DeviantArt's sitback page without having to install Flash.

## Install

Just, uh, click on the userscript and download from 'raw' display mode?
